            // DOM Manipulation (Correct way like React)
            //  - We saw how we can render data on webpage according to the state
            //    but there were problems like clearing the whole page etc.
            //  - Here we will update the webpage like react does i.e, calculating the
            //    diff and accordingly render only changed data instead of clearing the
            //    whole webpage upfront.
            //  - We'll follow the below steps: (This is the whole crux of React)
            //      - Update the state variable (Important to calculate the diff)
            //      - delegate the task of calculating diff to another hefty function (react)
            //      - tell that hefty function how to update, remove or add elements  (reactDom)

            //  - REACT JS Foundation
            //      - React: It calculates the "diff"
            //      - ReactDom: it tells react how to put, update or remove things on DOM
            //      - React Native: it tells react this is how to put, update or remove things on Native application
            //
            //  - React is very optimised so it doesn't put the changed state changes from virtual DOM
            //    to Real DOM immediatly, we waits for bunch of changes to come and then updates the DOM, i.e, update etc
            //    (unlike what we are doing here and updating everything, we are just mimicking how react works
            //    under the hood)

            let globalId = 0;
            let todoState = [];
            let oldToDoState = [];
            function addToDO() {}
            function removeToDo() {}
            function updateToDO() {}
