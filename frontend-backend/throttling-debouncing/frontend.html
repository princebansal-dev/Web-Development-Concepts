        <!--         
        - I have added oninput => as soon as we type at each keystroke, 
          populateDiv() was called and request goes to backend. 
          (now instead of populateDiv() we are calling deboucePopulateDiv(), you'll see why)
          
         Debouncing Concept:
        - Real world example: like on amazon when we search for product: 
            - if we type slowly then we see suggestions of similar spelled 
              products in search box => here also request is going on at backend
              logic which is returning us those suggestions 
            - But if we type fast then those product suggestions
              shows after a delay => request is going after a certian delay
              => this is called Debouncing 
            - It is used for optimising the performance as we are
              optimising the request fequency
    -->
        Number-1:
        <input
            id="a"
            oninput="debouncePopulateDiv()"
            type="text"
            placeholder="69"
        />
        <br />
        Number-2:
        <input
            id="b"
            oninput="debouncePopulateDiv()"
            type="text"
            placeholder="72"
        />
        <div id="sum"></div>

        <script>
            // Implementing Debouncing (FrontEnd):
            // - we'll call debouncePopulateDiv() instead of populateDiv() directly
            //   as it will wait for lets say 100 ms when user is typing the input.
            // - Now 2 cases can be there:
            //   1. if user doesn't type in those 100 ms
            //      => it needs to call populateDiv() (as user waits we need to give suggestion or result)
            //   2. if user types again in those 100 ms
            //      => it again needs to wait 100 ms, instead of calling populateDiv()
            //      (as user is still gonna type, so we'll hold off showing suggestions yet and
            //      hence optimising request frequencey)
            //
            // Some things to know about setTimeOut():
            //   - The setTimeout function in JavaScript returns a timeoutID. This is a numeric value that
            //     uniquely identifies the timer created by the function call.
            //   - You can use this timeoutID to cancel the timer before it expires using the
            //     clearTimeout() function.
            //
            //  Now, here the flow is like: (Dry Run of debounce)
            //   - 1st time when user types, debouncePoplateDiv() gets called
            //   - clearTimeOut() gets called with undefined value of timeoutId => it does nothing
            //     as no clock was running
            //   - the setTimeout() gets called and waits for 500 ms, timeoutId for running clock generated
            //     and if user is typing before 500 ms completed => debouncePopulateDiv() called
            //   - this time when clearTimeOut() called, it have the previous clock timeoutId
            //     => it clears that clock
            //   - and again setTimeOut() is called for 500ms (which is essentially what we want
            //     if user start typing before the wait time, we'll hold off the backend request)

            let myTimeoutId;
            function debouncePopulateDiv() {
                // we need to reset previous clock (if any running)
                clearTimeout(myTimeoutId);
                // we delayed calling populateDiv() by 500 ms
                // (to see real time difference, i increased the time)
                myTimeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
                    populateDiv();
                }, 500);
            }
            // Above debonce function is generic we can pass any following function
            // to make optimise requests after passing them instead of populateDiv()

            async function populateDiv() {
                const num1 = parseInt(document.getElementById("a").value);
                const num2 = parseInt(document.getElementById("b").value);
                const response = await fetch(
                    `http://localhost:3000/sum?a=${num1}&b=${num2}`
                );
                const ans = await response.text();
                document.getElementById(
                    "sum"
                ).innerHTML = `<h5>Sum is: ${ans}</h5>`;
            }
