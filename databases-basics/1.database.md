1. Until now, data was stored in-memory, which is bad for few reasons:
 - There are multiple servers in real world, we can't be writing in memory data in all of them, and if server crashes then data is lost in it - basically inconsistency issues
 - Data won't be dynamic, if we update in memory objects and server crashes or process restarts => data will be lost and back to initial data

2. In real world, basic architecture looks like:

    `Browser ------->  Backend ---------> Database`

   - user hits the backends (there can be multiple)
   - backend hits the database
   - user can't directly access database

3. There are multiple types of Databases
   - SQL DBs
   - NoSql DBs
   - Vector DBs
   - Graph DBs
4. How does backends connect to Databases?
   - Using Libraries
   - Like below libraries: 
     - `Express` lets you create HTTP servers
     - `jsonwebtoken` lets you create JWT signed tokens
     - `Mongoose` lets you connect to your database

5. We'll first do mongoose connection test example. 

6. In next file `3.mongoConnect.js` we'll do the following:
     - Connect to mongo db using `mongoose` library
     - We'll have 3 routes: `/signup`, `/signin`, `/users`
       - `/signup`: user will send `email`, `password`, `name`  in body and we'll put it in DB provided same user email doesn't exists
       - `/signin`: we'll check if user exits in db or not with correct password, if it does => return JWT signed token.
       - `/users`: user sends header with his jwt token, we'll return all the users present in db (except the logged in user itself)
